 * Deliberately NOT a formal/binding privacy policy or Impressum. 3Speak is framed as

 * operator/controller, no vendor, and no location — it's a good-faith transparency

        <h2>Read this first: 3Speak runs on a public blockchain</h2>
        <p>
          When you post a video, comment, vote or reshare on 3Speak, it is signed with your own
          Hive keys and broadcast to the <strong>Hive blockchain</strong> — a public, permanent,
          decentralised ledger. Anyone in the world can read it, and copies exist on servers we do
          not control.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>This content cannot be deleted — not by us, not by you, not by anyone.</strong>{' '}
          Deleting your 3Speak account removes our copies and stops us showing your content here,
          but the blockchain records remain public forever. Please do not publish anything you may
          later need removed.

        <h2>1. Getting in touch</h2>
        <p>
          3Speak is maintained by a decentralised collective of contributors rather than a single
          operating company. For any question about your data, or to ask us to send or delete the
          data 3Speak holds, contact <a href="mailto:privacy@3speak.tv">privacy@3speak.tv</a> or

        <h2>3. What we store in your browser</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your login, the settings you choose (theme, volume, language, subtitles, feed
          preferences) and — if you allow it — where you left off in each video, all in your
          browser's local storage. None of this is advertising or tracking, and the video-resume
          data never leaves your device. You control the optional part through the cookie banner
          shown on your first visit. See the banner's “What exactly is stored?” for the full list.

      <section>
        <h2>4. Who else receives data</h2>
        <p>
          To run the service we rely on a small number of third-party providers — for hosting,
          content delivery and email — who process data on our behalf and only as needed to
          provide 3Speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything you publish also goes to the <strong>Hive blockchain and IPFS</strong> —
          public, decentralised networks that are outside our control.

      <section>
        <h2>5. International transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Where one of these providers is outside the EU/EEA, such transfers are made under
          appropriate safeguards — for example the European Commission's Standard Contractual
          Clauses or an adequacy decision.

        <h2>6. How long we keep it</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Watch-statistics rows: 365 days, then automatically deleted.</li>
          <li>Server access logs: IP addresses are truncated at the point of writing; logs rotate within ~14 days.</li>
          <li>Measurement sessions: minutes (they expire automatically).</li>
          <li>Account-related records: for as long as you have an account, then removed on request.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Your rights</h2>
        <p>Under the GDPR you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>access the data we hold about you (Art. 15);</li>
          <li>have it corrected (Art. 16) or erased (Art. 17);</li>
          <li>restrict or object to processing (Art. 18, 21);</li>
          <li>receive your data in a portable format (Art. 20).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use the form under <em>Settings → About / Contact</em> or email{' '}
          <a href="mailto:privacy@3speak.tv">privacy@3speak.tv</a>. We respond within one month. Note
          the blockchain limit explained at the top: we can remove our own copies, but not the
          public ledger.
        </p>
        <p>
          You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory
          authority — in particular in the EU member state where you live or work, or where you
          believe the issue occurred.

      <section>
        <h2>8. No automated decisions with legal effect</h2>
        <p>
          Our feeds rank videos by popularity and your chosen interests, but this does not produce
          any decision with a legal or similarly significant effect on you (Art. 22).
