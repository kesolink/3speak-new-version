/**
 * "Open shorts on start" — when enabled, launching 3Speak drops the user straight
 * into /shorts instead of the home feed.
 *
 * Fires only ONCE per page load, and only when the app was actually opened on the
 * home route. Without that guard it would hijack every later navigation back to
 * "/" (tapping the logo, the Home tab, a back button) and you could never reach the
 * home feed again.
 *
 * We PUSH rather than replace, so "/" stays on the history stack and Back from the
 * shorts view lands on the home feed. That's safe precisely because of the one-shot
 * `done` ref above: this component is mounted once at the app root and never
 * unmounts on navigation, so returning to "/" cannot re-trigger the redirect. (A
 * `replace` would drop "/" entirely and Back would leave the app.)
 *
 * Note this only affects the app-open case. If the user reaches /shorts by normal
 * navigation, Back just follows real history as usual — nothing special here.
 *
 * The preference itself is persisted by the zustand store (localStorage), so it
 * survives a reload. Off by default.
