/**
 * Send a boost to a live streamer.
 *
 * The receiving half of boosts was already wired — <StreamVideo> renders
 * <BoostOverlay>, so boosts played over the stream — but nothing ever mounted
 * the SEND dialog, which made the feature look broken: viewers could see boosts
 * but had no way to send one.
 *
 * MUST be rendered inside <StandaloneWatch>: the room's boost config and guest
 * flag come from the stream context, and SendBoostDialog reads the API base and
 * signing wallet from the Hangouts provider above it.
 *
 * `variant` picks the shape for the surface it sits on:
 *   - `rail`    shorts-style action rail (mobile stream page)
 *   - `button`  a normal watch-page action button
 *   - `overlay` floats over the player, next to the viewer count
