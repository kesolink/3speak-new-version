/**
 * Asks a viewer, once, whether they want a share of ad revenue for what they watch.
 *
 * 🚨 THE SERVER DECIDES WHETHER TO ASK, NOT localStorage.
 * The answer is a consent record, so "have we asked?" has to be the same fact
 * everywhere: a localStorage flag would re-ask on every new device and, worse,
 * could show the prompt to somebody who already declined on their phone. The read
 * route returns `decided` precisely so this component never has to guess.
 *
 * Because the question is "may we store your username", declining is a real answer
 * that we record and then respect. There is no third showing.
