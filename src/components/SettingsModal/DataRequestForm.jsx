/**
 * GDPR data-subject request form — "send me my data" (Art. 15) and "delete my
 * account data" (Art. 17), living in Settings → About / Contact.
 *
 * The explainer is the point of this component, not the form. It has to be honest
 * about the one thing a blockchain front-end cannot do: your posts, comments,
 * votes and reshares live on Hive, signed and broadcast by YOUR keys to a public,
 * immutable ledger. We can delete our copy. Nobody can delete the chain. Promising
 * otherwise with a delete button that quietly does nothing would be worse than
 * having no button at all.
