/**
 * The chrome around a shorts spot: who it is from, that it is an ad, and how long is
 * left of it.
 *
 * NO SKIP BUTTON, and no way out generally — the feed's own navigation is disabled for
 * the length of the spot too. What keeps that from being a trap is that the countdown
 * is not the player's: it runs off the server-reported duration in Short.jsx, ticks
 * down on a plain interval, and ends the spot when it reaches zero whatever the video
 * element is doing. A spot with no duration ends immediately rather than never.
 *
 * 🚨 Draws NO video. The shorts feed has exactly one <video> element on purpose —
 * iOS will not play a second one — so the spot is loaded into that same persistent
 * player and this only sits on top of it. Creating a video element here would break
 * shorts playback on every iPhone.
 *
 * Unlike the watch-page banner, this is honestly blockable: it is a DOM node, and a
 * cosmetic filter can hide it. That is an accepted trade here — hiding the label does
 * not hide the spot, because the spot IS the video that is playing. The disclosure is
 * the thing at risk, not the impression, which is the right way round.
