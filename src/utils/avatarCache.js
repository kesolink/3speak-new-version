// loaded your old picture keeps showing it for a DAY after you change it, no
// matter what the chain says — it reads as "my upload didn't work".
//
// Two layers fix that, both preferred over the proxy URL:
//   1. override — the exact image WE just uploaded, set the moment it's saved.
//   2. resolved — profile_image read straight out of the account's
//      posting_json_metadata. Those URLs are content addressed, so they are
//      immutable and can never go stale.
// The proxy stays as the fallback: it generates a default face for accounts
// with no picture at all.
