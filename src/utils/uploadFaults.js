/**
 * Upload fault injection — a test harness for the upload failure modes we cannot
 * reproduce on a normal connection.
 *
 * The bugs that bite real users live on networks we can't borrow: a carrier that
 * silently eats the TUS PATCH method, or a middlebox that accepts an upload POST
 * and then black-holes it. Both are invisible on a healthy line. This lets us
 * trigger them on demand.
 *
 * WHO: badadib only (hardcoded — no env var, nothing to misconfigure). Every entry
 * point re-checks; there is no way to arm this as another user.
 *
 * HOW: both upload paths ultimately run on XMLHttpRequest — tus-js-client uses it
 * for PATCH, and the chunked fallback's postForm uses it directly — so one XHR
 * patch reaches both. It is installed lazily (only once a fault is actually armed)
 * and only ever alters requests to the upload endpoints; everything else on the
 * page goes through untouched.
 *
 * Flags live in sessionStorage so they survive the navigation between the upload
 * steps, and die with the tab.

/**
 * Is the weak-link profile being forced?
 *
 * Unlike the flags above this is NOT an XHR fault — nothing is intercepted. It
 * only makes getConnectionProfile() report `weak`, which is what selects the
 * small-chunk / multi-worker upload profile. That profile is otherwise
 * unreachable on a healthy office line, so without this it could only ever be
 * tested by finding a genuinely bad mobile connection.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT slow anything down: browser request-level throttling
 * cannot pace an XHR body (the panel says as much), so simulating real slowness
 * is not on offer. What this DOES verify is the part that actually changed —
 * that the weak profile fans out to several concurrent chunk POSTs and that the
 * upload reassembles correctly. Tick it together with "flaky link" to also
 * exercise retry + /status resync while several workers are in flight, which is
 * the closest we can get to the conditions that cost a real upload 68 minutes.
