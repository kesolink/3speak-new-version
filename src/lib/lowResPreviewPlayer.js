/**
 * Shared factory for a muted, LOWEST-rendition SDK Player used for cheap video
 * previews — the hover-to-play cards on the homepage AND the scrubber seek
 * preview both use it. Zero extra storage: it reuses the video's existing
 * lowest HLS variant (produced at encode time) instead of a storyboard/GIF.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — we pick the lowest rendition by BITRATE, not by level index. The
 * old `startLevel: 0 / autoLevelCapping: 0` assumed the smallest variant is
 * first in the manifest, which is true for the legacy encoder (240p→720p) but
 * BACKWARDS for the embed encoder, which lists variants highest-first (1080p =
 * index 0). That pinned embed previews to 1080p. Instead: a tiny bandwidth
 * estimate makes ABR start on the smallest rung, and once the manifest's levels
 * are known we lock `currentLevel`/`autoLevelCapping` to the lowest-bitrate one.
 *
 * @param {HTMLVideoElement} videoEl  element to attach the player to
 * @param {object} opts
 * @param {boolean} [opts.loop]                loop (cards) vs one-shot (scrubber)
 * @param {boolean} [opts.requirePreviewRung]  when true, ABORT the stream if the
 *   preview's smallest rung isn't smaller than the rung the MAIN player is already
 *   streaming — a preview there would just re-download the exact segments playback
 *   needs (old 3Speak/embed videos bottom out at 480p). Used by the scrubber preview
 *   so it never duplicates playback.
 * @param {() => number} [opts.getPlaybackHeight]  returns the main player's current
 *   rung height (px), or 0 if unknown. The skip test compares against it; with no
 *   getter (or 0) it falls back to a static "≤360p is the only rung worth a separate
 *   stream" cutoff.
 * @param {() => void} [opts.onNoPreviewRung]  called when the stream is aborted
 *   for the reason above, so the caller can fall back (e.g. timestamp-only scrub).
 * @returns {import('@mantequilla-soft/3speak-player').Player}
