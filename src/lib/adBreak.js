/**
 * Client half of server-side ad insertion, for the SDK-based watch page.

 * package: the two live in different services with different build chains, and a
 * new npm dependency between them costs more than this duplication does. If a
 * third player ever needs it, that is the moment to extract it.
 *
 * The spot is already inside the playlist by the time the player sees it, so
 * nothing here fetches an ad and there is no request for a blocker to match. What
 * this does is the bookkeeping the player cannot do alone:
 *
 *  1. ASK whether this playback carries a spot, and hand back a source to load.
 *  2. MAP the player's timeline back to content time. The important one: in a
 *     stitched stream currentTime includes the ad, so every ad second would
 *     otherwise be recorded as watch time against the creator's video — poisoning
 *     the retention data the ad forecast is itself built from.
 *  3. Say when the playhead is inside the break, so a Sponsored label can show.
 *
 * Every failure path returns "no ad". A video must never fail to play because the
 * ad system had a bad day.
