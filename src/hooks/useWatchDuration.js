/**
 * Drives the snapievideoplayer watch-duration heartbeat against the player
 * backend (getPlayerUrl()) from an SDK usePlayer() instance.
 *
 *   POST /api/watch/start → opens a server-side session (HMAC token bound to
 *     sid.owner.permlink.ip), returns a beat interval.
 *   POST /api/watch/beat  → sent (throttled) while the video is really playing
 *     AND this tab is the one in front, plus a final beat on pause / tab-hide /
 *     unmount. The server credits only the wall-clock gap it measures between
 *     beats, so watch time can't be forged with a single request.
 *
 * Tab visibility is part of "really playing" on purpose: a short video left
 * running in a background tab used to accrue watch time exactly like one
 * someone was watching. The hide itself still flushes a beat, so the seconds up
 * to that moment count; the beats simply stop until the tab comes back. The
 * server caps any single beat at MAX_BEAT_CREDIT_MS (8s), so returning to a
 * long-hidden tab credits at most that much of the time away, not the whole gap.
 *
 * LONG-FORM IS THE EXCEPTION. Past BACKGROUND_OK_SECONDS the background tab is
 * the point: podcasts, interviews, DJ sets and long talks get listened to with
 * the tab parked, and that is real watch time, not a video nobody is with. So
 * anything that long keeps beating while hidden. Below the threshold, a
 * forgotten tab is far more likely than deliberate listening.
 *
 * Records watched seconds + % of duration (with the viewer IP + video) into the
 * backend's `view-durations` collection. This is the "non-polluting" path — it
 * NEVER increments the view counter (mirrors the /play route), so preview
 * playback doesn't inflate production view counts.
